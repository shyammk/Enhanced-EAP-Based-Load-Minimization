# Enhanced-EAP-Based-Load-Minimization

A simulation project involving identification of telecom (mobile) towers closer to geographical borders as border base stations and rest as interior base stations. The idea is to send the control information related to a mobile station only from these border base stations, when a MS approaches the border. This helps reduce the load on the controller resulting in faster and efficient data transmissions.
